# Script Tutorial for BKEngine

**BKEngine** is a cross-platform AVG engine. Visit their [website](https://bke.bakery.moe/) for detailed information.  
This is a collection of **BKEngine** sample scripts. It could be a tutorial for programmers.  

You should be able to write a game by **BKEngine** from scratch *if you read all scripts and comments :-p*  

The repo contains 13 different topics:  
* T1. Empty
* T2. Text
* T3. Sprit
* T4. UI
* T5. Action
* T6. Animation
* T7. Trans
* T8. Effect
* T9. Sound
* T10. Flow
* T11. Macro
* T12. Event
* T13. MISC
 
According to **BKEngine**'s author, the engine is still under development.  
This repo might not be up-to-date if newer version engine released. It also won't cover all topics since **BKEngine** has a lot of features.
